In 2016, many more Singaporeans are giving birth between 30 - 34 years old. Likely the result of an increasingly ambitious female workforce which focuses on building their career first?

In fact, there is an increasing trend of 35-39s giving birth, and a decreasing trend of those in their 25 - 29s. What is the impact of this on our society? Not just on the health of the babies or riskier pregnancies for mothers above 35  - parents continue to provide for their children, even as they turn 50, or 55. Perhaps a greater generation gap, a greater cultural disconnect between parents and their children in the future? How does this impact family bonds? More importantly, is there anything we can do to address this?

On a more macro view - generation turnover slows, doesn't it? As the world changes much more quickly, the more change we, as each individual, witness across our (longer) lifetime. We, as individuals, may become more hardy (or bendy, flexible, however you see it) - but as a society, do we evolve slower? #timetogoogle
